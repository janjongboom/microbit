# Juggling

This is the juggling stuff with DAL. The non-DAL and finished version will end up at http://github.com/web-bluetooth/juggling. If you don't have access to the DAL, use the firmware from there, it will be flashable.

## How to use

1. Build the project and flash on microbit
2. Go into server, run `npm install`
3. Run `node server.js`
4. Open browser and go to http://localhost:7001 and start juggling

It also does free fall detection (logged to stdout) so throw your microbit in the air :-)
